As I conclude my mission as CEO of **Creodynamics** (August 2020 – December 2022), I look back on a period defined by intense transformation. Taking the helm of this Linköping-based center of excellence during the height of the global pandemic was a challenge that required not just management, but a complete strategic reimagining of how high-level physics expertise fits into the modern industrial world.


My mandate was clear, though complex: take a company renowned for its niche R&D brilliance and **scale it up** to meet the rigorous demands of global markets.

## The Imperative to Scale Up

When I arrived in 2020, Creodynamics was already a jewel of technology. The challenge was not capability; it was scalability. We needed to transition from a "boutique consultancy" model—solving one-off complex problems—to an industrial engine capable of deploying solutions across millions of units.

Over these 30 months, we shifted our focus from selling hours of expertise to selling scalable technology blocks. We implemented rigorous processes that allowed us to maintain our "start-up" agility while adhering to the heavy industrial standards required by Tier-1 automotive and major defense contracts.

## Bridging Two Worlds: Aerospace & Defense and Automotive

One of the most defining aspects of this tenure was managing the duality of our portfolio. We stood at the crossroads of two very different industries:

1.  **Aerospace & Defense:** This is Creodynamics' heritage. We continued to support critical programs where precision is absolute and failure is impossible.
2.  **Automotive:** As part of the Faurecia (FORVIA) ecosystem, we had to inject that aerospace rigor into the cost-constrained, high-volume automotive world.

My role was to act as the bridge. We leveraged the advanced simulation methodologies and structural analysis tools from our Defense projects to solve NVH (Noise, Vibration, Harshness) challenges in next-generation electric vehicles. This cross-pollination was the key to our growth.

## The Technological Breakthrough: Active Noise Control (ANC)

Nowhere was this scale-up more evident than in our work on **Active Noise Control (ANC)**.

During this period, we moved ANC from an experimental concept to a market-ready reality. As vehicles became electrified, the removal of the combustion engine unveiled new, intrusive road noises. We positioned Creodynamics as the leader in solving this new acoustic reality.

We didn't just model the sound; we developed the software algorithms and hardware integration strategies to cancel it out in real-time. Turning this complex wave physics into a robust, embedded software product for mass-market vehicles was the ultimate proof of our successful scale-up.

## Navigating International Waters

Leading a Swedish high-tech entity as a French executive within a global group presented its own set of cultural and operational challenges. It required navigating the consensus-driven, highly innovative Swedish business culture while driving the aggressive targets of a global industrial group.

I am incredibly proud of the team at Creodynamics. Together, we proved that you can respect the deep roots of scientific research while aggressively pursuing industrial growth. We leave the company not just larger, but fundamentally stronger—ready to define the sound of the future.
